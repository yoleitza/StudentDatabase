# StudentDatabase
Student Database in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
Database created for a training company during my internship period from the Bow Valley College Tech Skills program
The database created contains data from online classess as well as classroom classes.
The data cleaning was done partially in Excel and the rest in SSMS.

I am only including the SQL code, could not share the excel files since they are student personal information.
